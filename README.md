## 🦧 Wild Animal Quartet
### Task
Create a website that displays all 32 cards of an animal quartet. This website includes the following features:
- Common website elements (header, etc.)
- The animal data is loaded from a JSON file, and the cards are created via script for each entry in the dataset. You can choose to use jQuery for this.
- The website uses both CSS grid and flexbox. Additionally, a Google Font is embedded.
- The website is responsive (2 views, two CSS files).
  - In the mobile view, all cards are displayed in a single column. The layout is optimized for mobile devices.
  - In the desktop view, the cards are displayed differently (e.g., in groups of 4). The layout is noticeably different from the mobile view.

### Remix Function
Try out the **Remix** function to see the cards in action with confetti effects! Hover over the cards to interact and see them come to life.
